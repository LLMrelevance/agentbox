# Harness boundary

Agentbox owns task scheduling, isolated folders, delivery, and the approval UI.
A harness owns its native protocol, account home, models, commands, and session
state. The shared definitions contain names, flags, and capabilities; the main
process registry contains executable adapters. The renderer never imports it.

`main/harnesses.mjs` lists the operations and validates registrations. Reads
such as usage can report `{ supported: false }`. Unsupported actions throw
before doing anything. Unknown explicit engines are refused at this boundary;
legacy recovery records retain the supervisor's existing Claude normalization.
No directory scan, third-party plugin loader, new dependency, or background
service is involved.

Claude's JSON lines and Codex's notifications remain native to their adapters.
They expose the same capture, live text, activity, summary, and trace operations
without converting Codex notifications to pretend Claude output. Session
transcripts, account keys, credential-file watching, setup, model commands,
updates, and worker environments are also selected through the adapter.

Native Codex RPC lifecycle helpers and Claude Remote Control still live in
their existing modules. Their security, locking, and scheduling rules are not
interchangeable. Existing settings snapshots and the two-engine admission gate
remain compatible. A registry test proves dispatch with an offline third
adapter; it does not claim a third provider is integrated or runnable.

## The command line is data

A definition's `run` block holds the flags that start a worker: the print flag,
the output format, the streaming flags, and the effort, system, resume, fork and
streaming-input flags. `workerArgsFrom` builds the line from it in a fixed
order, and a key left out means the engine does not take that flag rather than
that a default applies. An engine driven over RPC has no `run` and is handed no
command line. So an engine that speaks a command line we already parse — Grok
Build emits Claude Code's stream-json — is a definition entry, not an edit to
the supervisor.

## Adding a harness

Add a definition and an adapter, then explicitly wire discovery and enrollment.
Keep the default and existing accounts unchanged. Declare missing capabilities,
and test actual start, resume, correction, cancellation, approval, denial, and
delivery against the provider's native transport. A provider is not offered
until that path works. Never infer permission from terminal text or mark missing
usage as zero. Capability declarations must describe what the adapter can do.

## What a harness can do is what it says

`createHarnessRegistry` used to answer `supports()` by asking whether the
adapter had a function of that name. That was the whole truth while every
adapter was written by hand for one tool. One adapter serving several tools
over a shared protocol breaks it, because it implements every operation for all
of them. So an adapter may also declare availability: `available(name)` returns
false for an operation this tool did not negotiate, `supports()` believes it,
and a declined operation is refused exactly as a missing one is — before it
does anything, and reported as absent rather than as zero.

## The Agent Client Protocol, and what it settles

`main/acp.mjs` is one transport for every agent that speaks ACP: JSON-RPC 2.0
over stdio, one object per line. It holds the wire and no opinion about which
tool is on the other end. Decided while building it, with Codex reviewing:

- ONE ADAPTER, BUT NOT EVERYTHING AS DATA. Binary arguments, install and login
  commands, profile paths and supported version ranges are data. Authentication
  parsing, session lifecycle, permission handling, cancellation and replay stay
  code. Speaking ACP does not make a tool resumable: `session/load` is optional,
  so resume is read off what the agent advertised, never assumed.
- ONE PROCESS PER ACTIVE ITEM to begin with, so a crash, a leak or a forced
  cancellation is contained to one item. Codex's shared app-server per profile
  is proven and stays as it is. Pooling ACP is a later change and needs a
  measurement of the whole process tree first, not an estimate.
- EVENTS STAY NATIVE, presentation is normalised. `session/update` is kept as
  the tool sent it and read through the same capture, stream, summarize, trace
  and activity readers as every other engine, so no protocol knowledge reaches
  the renderer and nothing is translated into pretend Claude stream-json.
  Replaying a loaded session must not re-deliver an answer, and a prompt's
  `stopReason` decides delivery: cancellation, a limit or a dead transport is
  not a success because text happened to arrive.
- APPROVALS REUSE THE SPOOL, not a third approval system. ACP returns the exact
  `optionId` the agent offered, so Allow can never land as `allow_always`. A
  denial picks an offered rejection option; if the agent offered none, the turn
  is cancelled rather than an id invented. A cancelled turn answers `cancelled`,
  every question is answered exactly once, and reading continues while one
  waits. The failure to design against first is a denial that is not enforced:
  a well-formed refusal on the wire proves nothing about what the tool then did.

## Credentials: the line, decided

A worker never receives a provider API key in its environment, and moving one
to disk is the same violation by another route. The line is a subscription-
backed authentication mode, managed by the tool itself, with no API-key
fallback. A bring-your-own-key tool is not supported as an engine; it is not
half-supported.

So an ACP worker gets a minimal environment with every vendor's provider keys
removed, not only its own engine's prefix, and the same constraint applies to
any MCP server or child process it is configured to start. Before a tool is
offered at all, a readiness check runs in that exact worker environment and
profile: resolve a supported binary and version, read the tool's own
authentication status, negotiate ACP, confirm the required capabilities, and
open a session without submitting work. It answers with one of "Ready", "Sign
in", "Subscription authentication unsupported" or "Installed version
unsupported". A credential file existing is not readiness, and authentication
that expires later is surfaced on the item rather than spent on retries.

## Offering an engine: two levels

Required before a tool is offered to anyone: subscription authentication, our
standing instructions actually reaching it, store access, start, durable resume
across a real process death, cancel, an enforced approval and denial,
transcript capture, and delivery. Optional, and drawn as unavailable when
missing: usage meters, model choice beyond a verified default, compaction,
command menus and automatic updates. Unknown usage is never zero usage, and a
tool without compaction is acceptable only if running out of context is a
recoverable outcome someone can understand.

## Hermes integration direction

The proposed first integration is an optional local task session over Hermes'
first-party ACP interface. A task has its own conversation and working folder;
Hermes keeps its own persistent memory and skills in its configured home. No
gateway, cron, messaging connector, or daemon is started by Agentbox. Users who
want Hermes' always-on gateway continue to run it separately. Connecting that
gateway to the inbox would be a distinct integration with explicit ownership
of scheduling, approvals, and messages, rather than a requirement for support.

Provider credentials stay in the harness' own authentication/configuration
store. Agentbox does not ask for, copy, or inject provider API keys. Claude and
Codex keep their existing subscription environment scrubs. Hermes and OpenCode
admission remains off until native credential loading, configured MCP isolation,
and real approval/denial are verified. A new provider's networking or permission
scope requires the corresponding product policy review before admission.

The useful precedent from T3 Code is an adapter between provider behavior and
orchestration. Herdr keeps agents in normal terminals and uses detection
manifests or reported states; Agentbox continues to use structured protocols.
